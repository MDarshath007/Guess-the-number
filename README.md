🚀 Just Completed a Fun Mini Project — Guess The Number Game! 🎮
I built a simple interactive game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 🔹 The computer generates a random number between 1 and 10
 🔹 The player enters a guess
 🔹 If the guess is correct → You Win! 🎉
 🔹 If the guess is wrong → Score decreases
 🔹 When the score reaches 0 → Game Over ❌
 
🧠 What I learned while building this:

 ✔ DOM manipulation
 ✔ Input handling
 ✔ Conditional statements
 ✔ Basic game logic
 ✔ UI feedback and alert interactions
